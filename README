The objective is a file system viewer/queryer that runs locally on Node.js and web browser

Same code should run on Win, Mac, Nix machines

To get started:

You only need Node installed
Git or copy files to "fsq" folder
In term command line, type "node fsq/fsq.js" (obviously from one level up)
In browser, type "localhost:8124"

Basics:

Node.js displays a blank web page at localhost
User selects a folder to target
Ajax gets a json collection of data from fs (filesystem)
Client creates the visual display

Future prospects:

Using html5 should make web client far surpass other options in visual and ease-of-use for most uses

Initial objectives:

1. Navigate intuitively
2. See clean but customizable lists or icons or combination
3. Show the type, size and age of files graphically
4. Allow user to create/persist positional clustering (as per desktops)

Further possibilities:

1. Act on files (open, move, etc.)
2. Preview contents
3. Advanced search, etc.
4. Tree views, two-panel views, etc. (But, usability first - often trees are balky)
