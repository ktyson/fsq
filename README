The objective is a file system viewer/queryer that runs locally on Node.js

Same code should run on Win and Mac machines

Using html5 should make web client far surpass other options in visual and ease-of-use for most uses

Initial objectives:

1. Navigate intuitively
2. See clean but customizable lists or icons or combo
3. Show type, size and age graphically
4. Allow user to create/persist positional clustering (as per desktops)

Further possibilities:

1. Act on files (open, move, etc.)
2. Preview contents
3. Advanced search, etc.
4. Tree views, two-panel views, etc. (But, usability first - often trees are balky)

Basics:

Node.js displays a blank web page at localhost
User selects a folder to target
Ajax gets a json collection of data
Client creates the visual display
